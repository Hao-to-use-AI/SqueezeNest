# SqueezeNest

General-purpose 2D irregular nesting and dimensional sensitivity ("squeeze-to-fit") engine.

## Overview

SqueezeNest is a Python library for packing 2D irregular polygons onto a rectangular stock sheet (nesting). It features DXF ingestion, collision-free placement using exact integer arithmetic, and a unique **Dimensional Sensitivity Sweep** that explores whether minor part deformations (e.g., scaling down by 1-5%) can unlock higher material yields.

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic 2D Irregular Nesting (Bottom-Left Fill)

```python
from squeezenest.api.models import StockSheet, RotationSet, NestingStrategy
from squeezenest._nesting.blf import run_nesting_job

# Define stock sheet (100x100 mm)
stock = StockSheet(width_mm=100.0, height_mm=100.0)

# Define a part: (outer_boundary_pts, [hole_pts_list])
l_shape = (
    [(0.0, 0.0), (30.0, 0.0), (30.0, 15.0), (15.0, 15.0), (15.0, 30.0), (0.0, 30.0)],
    [] 
)
parts_to_pack = [("L1", l_shape), ("L2", l_shape), ("L3", l_shape)]

# Run nesting
layout = bottom_left_fill(
    parts=parts_to_pack,
    stock=stock,
    clearance_mm=1.0,
    rotation_set=RotationSet.ORTHO,
)
print(f"Placed {layout.yield_count} parts.")
```

### 2. High-Yield Panelization (Lattice Tiling)

For homogeneous parts (e.g., mass-producing the exact same L-shape bracket), SqueezeNest provides a `Lattice Tiling` engine. It pairs parts into tightest interlocking clusters (e.g. Yin-Yang patterns) and mathematically tiles them to maximize density.

```python
from squeezenest.api.models import NestingJob, NestingStrategy

job = NestingJob(
    parts={"L": (l_shape, PartMetadata(part_id="L", quantity=40))},
    stock=[stock],
    clearance_mm=1.0,
    rotation_set=RotationSet.ORTHO,
    strategy=NestingStrategy.LATTICE
)
result = job.run()
print(f"Lattice tiled {result.layout.yield_count} parts.")
```

### 3. Ingesting DXF Files

```python
from pathlib import Path
from squeezenest._io.dxf_ingest import ingest_dxf

# Ingest DXF, healing micro-gaps (e.g. up to 0.01mm)
extracted_parts, report = ingest_dxf(Path("parts.dxf"), eps_snap_mm=0.01)

if not report.is_fatal:
    print(f"Extracted {len(extracted_parts)} valid closed parts from DXF.")
```

### 3. Dimensional Sensitivity Sweep ("Squeeze-to-Fit")

```python
from squeezenest.api.models import NestingJob, SensitivityConfig, StockSheet, PartMetadata, RotationSet
from squeezenest._sensitivity.sweep import run_sensitivity_sweep

# Setup job
job = NestingJob(
    parts={"PART_A": (my_polygon, PartMetadata(part_id="PART_A", quantity=10))},
    stock=[StockSheet(width_mm=25.0, height_mm=25.0)],
    clearance_mm=0.5,
    rotation_set=RotationSet.ORTHO,
)

# Configure the "squeeze" search grid
config = SensitivityConfig(
    scale_x_range=(0.95, 1.0),   # Allow scaling X down to 95%
    scale_y_range=(0.95, 1.0),   # Allow scaling Y down to 95%
    clearance_range=(0.3, 0.5),  # Explore clearance between 0.3mm and 0.5mm
    n_scale_x=3, n_scale_y=3, n_clearance=2,
)

sweep_result = run_sensitivity_sweep(job, config)
best = sweep_result.best_yield()
print(f"Max Yield achieved: {best.yield_count} (scale_x={best.scale_x:.2f}, scale_y={best.scale_y:.2f})")
```

### 4. Interactive PCB Panelization Web Demo

SqueezeNest includes an interactive local web studio to test panelization with custom `.dxf` CAD files, live 2D vector preview (SVG), stop controls, timeout protection, and direct DXF panel export.

```bash
# Launch the web demo server via CLI
squeezenest serve --port 8080
```

Then open your browser at: **http://localhost:8080**

### 5. Command Line Interface (CLI)

SqueezeNest provides a robust CLI via `typer`. You can run nesting jobs and sensitivity sweeps directly from your terminal:

```bash
# Basic Nesting
squeezenest nest parts.dxf --width 100.0 --height 100.0 --clearance 0.5 --strategy blf

# Genetic Algorithm (GA) Nesting Optimization
squeezenest nest parts.dxf --width 100.0 --height 100.0 --strategy ga

# Dimensional Sensitivity Sweep
squeezenest sweep parts.dxf --width 100.0 --height 100.0
```

*Note: SqueezeNest v0.2 features an SQLite-backed Tier-2 NFP cache with LRU eviction (limit 100 entries) to speed up repeated runs.*

## Appendix A: How It Works (Explained Simply)

Think of SqueezeNest like an ultra-smart version of Tetris for a laser cutter or a CNC machine.

### Expected Input
1. **The Shapes to Cut**: Either a CAD drawing file (`.dxf`) or a list of `(x, y)` coordinate points describing the shape outline (and any holes).
2. **The Sheet Size**: The dimensions of your raw board (e.g., 100x100 mm).
3. **The Rules & "Squeeze" Tolerance**: Clearance gap between pieces, allowed rotations (e.g., 90°), and whether the computer is allowed to shrink pieces slightly (e.g., 1-5%) to fit more.

### Expected Output
1. **The Cutting Layout (Blueprint)**: Exactly where each part goes on the sheet `(X, Y)` position and rotation angle.
2. **The Score (Yield)**: How many parts successfully fit.
3. **The "Squeeze" Trade-off (Pareto Frontier)**: A menu showing trade-offs, like: *"At 100% size, 4 parts fit. Shrink by 2%, and 6 parts fit."*

### The Pipeline Step-by-Step
1. **Clean & Fix (Ingestion)**: Reads the DXF. Heals tiny open gaps by snapping lines together so every shape is a solid, closed loop.
2. **Precision Guard (Integer Kernel)**: Converts millimeter floating-point numbers into nanometer integers (multiplies by 1,000,000). This prevents computer rounding errors from causing false overlapping or crashing the geometry engine.
3. **Greedy Nesting (Bottom-Left Fill)**: Slides shapes as far down and left as possible into the sheet without colliding.
4. **The Squeeze Tester (Sensitivity Sweep)**: Tests micro-adjustments to scale or clearance across a grid to discover if tiny deformations unlock higher yields.

## Appendix B: The Integer Math Scale Guard

Computers are notoriously bad at decimal math (e.g. `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004`). In geometry, this causes "false overlaps" or topological crashes. SqueezeNest solves this by using exact integer arithmetic.

All coordinates are multiplied by `1,000,000` and rounded to the nearest integer using round-half-up. 
- `1.0 mm` becomes `1,000,000`
- `0.001 mm` (1 micron) becomes `1,000`
- `0.000001 mm` (1 nanometer) becomes `1`

This provides perfect fixed-point math and guarantees geometry is immune to rounding drift, while maintaining a supported scale envelope of `[-9000 mm, 9000 mm]` with no risk of `int64` overflow.
