"""squeezenest._sensitivity.pareto -- Pareto frontier extraction.

Extracts the non-dominated frontier from a list of ParetoPoint objects.

Objectives (both to maximise yield, minimise cost):
  - yield_count:      Higher is better (maximise).
  - deformation_cost: Lower is better (minimise).

Dominance definition (strict): point B dominates point A if:
  B.yield_count >= A.yield_count  AND  B.deformation_cost <= A.deformation_cost
  AND at least one inequality is strict.

Invariant I-07: The returned frontier contains no dominated points.
