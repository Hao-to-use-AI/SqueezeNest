# SqueezeNest -- Technical Specification

**Version:** 0.1.0-draft  
**Status:** Pre-implementation  
**Module identity:** General-purpose 2D irregular nesting & dimensional sensitivity engine

---

## 1. Scope & Goals

SqueezeNest is a Python library (with a CLI surface) that solves two coupled problems:

| Problem | Description |
|---|---|
| **2D Irregular Nesting** | Place a set of arbitrarily shaped flat parts onto one or more rectangular stock sheets, minimising waste (maximising yield). |
| **Squeeze-to-Fit Sensitivity** | Given a set of parts that fail to nest into a target stock size, compute a Pareto frontier over two relaxation axes -- affine part scaling (sx, sy) and inter-part clearance (d_clearance) -- identifying the minimal deformation that achieves a target yield. |

The engine is intentionally domain-agnostic. Downstream fabrication-domain extensions (CNC routing, sheet-stock singulation) attach via typed Protocol contracts -- not monkey-patching.

---

## 2. Mathematical Model

### 2.1 Coordinate System & Units

All internal geometry operates on a **64-bit signed integer grid** (Clipper2 `int64` coordinates). Physical coordinates (millimetres) are mapped to integer sub-micron units at ingestion:

```
int_coord = round(mm_value x SCALE_FACTOR)
SCALE_FACTOR = 1_000_000   # 1 mm = 1,000,000 units (sub-micron resolution)
```

The maximum representable coordinate is +/-9,223,372,036 mm -- far beyond any physical stock size. This eliminates floating-point drift in all boolean clipping and Minkowski operations.

> **Invariant:** No floating-point coordinate may enter the Clipper2 kernel.
> All fp<->int conversions are isolated to the `_core.scale` module.

### 2.2 Part Geometry Model

A `Part` is modelled as a **Polygon with Holes**:

```
Part = {
    outer_boundary : SimplePolygon       # CCW winding (Clipper2 convention)
    holes          : List[SimplePolygon] # CW winding, each strictly inside outer_boundary
    metadata       : PartMetadata
}
```

`SimplePolygon` = a closed, non-self-intersecting sequence of int64 (x, y) vertices. Arcs, splines, and bulged LWPOLYLINE segments from DXF sources are **tessellated** to polylines before storage (sagitta/chord-error delta <= 0.01 mm by default, configurable).

Multi-contour parts (disconnected outer boundaries) are supported as `MultiPart = List[Part]`. The nesting engine treats each contour independently for collision and groups them for placement.

### 2.3 Affine Squeeze-to-Fit Model

When baseline nesting fails to achieve target yield `Y_target`, the engine enters sensitivity mode. Two relaxation axes are defined:

| Axis | Symbol | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| Horizontal scale factor | sx | [1 - dsx_max, 1.0] |
| Vertical scale factor | sy | [1 - dsy_max, 1.0] |
| Inter-part clearance | d | [d_min, d_baseline] |

Constraints may be specified as:
- **Relative**: `dsx_max = 0.02` (max 2% width reduction)
- **Absolute**: `dW_max = -1.5 mm` (converted to relative via part bounding box at ingestion)

The scaled geometry of part *i* under parameters (sx, sy) is computed about its centroid (cx, cy):

```
P_i(sx, sy) = { (sx*x - sx*cx + cx,  sy*y - sy*cy + cy) | (x,y) in P_i }
```

The engine sweeps a discrete parameter grid:

```
S = { (sx_k, sy_l, d_m) | k in [0..N_x], l in [0..N_y], m in [0..N_d] }
```

Each grid point `(sx, sy, d)` is an independent nesting run, yielding count `Y(sx, sy, d)`.

### 2.4 Pareto Frontier

The Pareto-optimal set is computed over:

```
Minimise:  deformation_cost(sx, sy, d) = w1*(1-sx) + w2*(1-sy) + w3*(d_baseline - d)
Maximise:  yield Y(sx, sy, d)
```

Weights (w1, w2, w3) are user-configurable (default: equal). Output is a `SensitivityResult` listing all Pareto-non-dominated points with human-readable bottleneck annotations, e.g. *"Reducing d_clearance by 0.2 mm alone increases yield from 12 to 15 (+25%)"*.

### 2.5 Minimum Feature Thickness Constraint

Before any scaling or offset operation, every part must satisfy:

```
for all feature_neck in Part:  width(feature_neck) >= 2 * kerf_radius + DFM_MIN_WEB
```

`DFM_MIN_WEB` defaults to 0.5 mm and is configurable per fabrication context. If a scaling step would violate this, that grid point is marked `TOPOLOGY_INVALID` and excluded from the Pareto sweep rather than silently splitting the part.

## 3. DXF Ingestion Pipeline

### 3.1 Stage Overview

```
DXF file
   |
   v
[Stage 1] Entity extraction (ezdxf)
   |  -> LINE, ARC, SPLINE, LWPOLYLINE, CIRCLE on target layers
   v
[Stage 2] Spatial graph construction
   |  -> KD-Tree endpoint index (scipy.spatial.KDTree)
   |  -> Snap endpoints within eps_snap (default 0.01 mm) -> bridge micro-gaps
   |  -> De-duplicate coincident segments (exact int-hash comparison)
   v
[Stage 3] Curve tessellation
   |  -> Arc -> polyline (sagitta delta <= 0.01 mm)
   |  -> B-Spline -> polyline (ezdxf adaptive sampling)
   |  -> Bulged LWPOLYLINE -> arc segments -> polyline
   v
[Stage 4] Chain assembly
   |  -> Walk adjacency graph -> closed chains
   |  -> Flag unclosed chains as DXF_GAP violations (not silent discard)
   v
[Stage 5] Clipper2 PolyTree reconstruction
   |  -> Union all chains -> resolve winding
   |  -> Classify outer boundary (CCW) vs holes (CW)
   |  -> Produce List[Part]
   v
[Stage 6] Pre-flight validation
      -> Feature thickness check
      -> Minimum hole diameter check (DFM_MIN_HOLE_DIA, default 0.8 mm)
      -> Emit structured ValidationReport
```

### 3.2 Layer Contract

By default, SqueezeNest reads entities from all layers (auto-detection mode). For deterministic CI ingestion, a strict layer contract can be enforced:

| Layer name (configurable) | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `OUTLINE` | Outer part boundary |
| `CUTOUT` | Interior holes / pockets |
| `KEEPOUT` | Clearance exclusion zones (spatial buffer only, not cut) |

Entities on unlisted layers: silently ignored in strict mode; `DXF_LAYER_UNKNOWN` INFO in permissive mode.

## 4. Clipper2 Geometric Pipeline

### 4.1 Scale Conversion

```python
# squeezenest/_core/scale.py
SCALE = 1_000_000  # mm -> int64

def to_int(mm: float) -> int:
    return round(mm * SCALE)

def to_mm(i: int) -> float:
    return i / SCALE
```

### 4.2 Kerf / Clearance Offset

All morphological offsets use **Clipper2 InflatePaths**:

- `JoinType = Miter` with `MiterLimit = 2.0` (prevents spike explosion on acute corners)
- `EndType = Polygon` (closed contours only)
- Negative offsets (erosion for kerf compensation) applied before NFP computation
- Post-offset validity check: polygon count change -> `DFM_NECK_PINCH` violation -> reject grid point

### 4.3 No-Fit Polygon (NFP) Computation

NFPs are computed via Minkowski difference approximation using Clipper2 offset + boolean difference:

```
NFP(A, B) = Boundary of { t in R^2 | (B translated by t) intersect A != empty }
```

Steps:
1. Reflect B around its reference point -> B'
2. Compute Minkowski sum A (+) B' via Clipper2 polygon offset cascade
3. NFP inner frontier = inner boundary of the resulting union

The placement engine uses NFPs to enumerate all valid non-overlapping positions for B relative to A in O(1) per query.

### 4.4 Collision Detection Hierarchy

```
Stage 1: AABB overlap check          O(1) scalar   - rejects ~70% of candidates
Stage 2: OBB (rotated bbox) check    O(1) scalar   - rejects ~85% cumulatively
Stage 3: Convex hull intersection    O(n+m)        - rejects ~97% cumulatively
Stage 4: Exact Clipper2 boolean      O(n*m*log)    - applied to remaining ~3%
```

The R-Tree (Shapely STRtree) indexes all placed part bounding boxes, reducing Stage 1 from O(n) scan to O(log n + k) query.

## 5. Two-Tier NFP Cache

### 5.1 Cache Key

```python
CacheKey = tuple[
    bytes,   # SHA-256 of polygon_A vertices (normalised: centroid->origin, lexsort)
    bytes,   # SHA-256 of polygon_B vertices
    int,     # rotation_A in 0.001-degree units  (e.g. 90000 = 90 deg)
    int,     # rotation_B in 0.001-degree units
    int,     # d_clearance in int64 units (quantised to SCALE)
]
```

Polygon hash normalisation: translate centroid to origin, lexicographically sort vertices to produce a canonical form independent of starting vertex and translation.

### 5.2 Tier 1 -- In-Process LRU Cache

- `cachetools.LRUCache`, default capacity: 4096 entries (~256 MB for complex polygons)
- Lifetime: single process / single `NestingJob.run()` call
- Partial invalidation: drop keys where the modified parameter dimension intersects

### 5.3 Tier 2 -- On-Disk Content-Addressable Store

- SQLite at `~/.squeezenest/nfp_cache.db` (XDG-compliant path)
- Schema: `(key_hash BLOB PRIMARY KEY, nfp_bytes BLOB, created_at INTEGER)`
- `nfp_bytes`: Clipper2 paths serialised as msgpack
- Workers open DB in read-only WAL mode; writes serialised through a main-process cache-writer thread

### 5.4 Invalidation Rules

| Change | Cache behaviour |
|---|---|
| (sx, sy) changes | Polygon hashes change -> full recompute |
| d_clearance changes only | Base polygon hashes unchanged -> partial recompute |
| New rotation added | Only new rotation keys miss |
| Cache capacity exceeded | LRU eviction (Tier 1 only; Tier 2 never auto-evicts) |

## 6. Placement Engine

### 6.1 Rotation Model

Discrete orthogonal rotations by default: {0 deg, 90 deg, 180 deg, 270 deg}.
Configurable discrete step (e.g. every 45 deg). Continuous rotation is out of scope for v0.x.

### 6.2 Bottom-Left-Fill with Beam Search

```
1. Sort part sequence by (area DESC, perimeter DESC) -- largest-first heuristic
2. For each beam candidate (B parallel sequences, default B=5):
   a. Take next unplaced part P with rotation r in Rotations
   b. Enumerate candidate placements along NFP frontier (touching-pair positions)
   c. Score by leftmost-then-bottommost packed centroid
   d. Select top-K placements -> expand beam
3. Return highest-yield beam
```

B=1 degrades to pure BLF greedy (fast). B=infinity is exhaustive (impractical for large sets).

### 6.3 Genetic Algorithm (v0.2, optional)

A GA optimises the **part sequence** passed to BLF, treating BLF as the fitness evaluator.
Genome = permutation of part indices. Crossover = Order Crossover (OX). Mutation = adjacent swap.
Fitness = yield count + compactness bonus.
